# Flight Management System
### Capstone Feature List | FastAPI + n8n + Supabase Postgres + Pinecone + RAG + Gmail

This document lists every feature/edge case for the flight management capstone, grouped into 10 domains (56 items total). 

**Architecture:** 
- **FastAPI** is the only write path for live booking and admin operations, and writes directly to Supabase Postgres.
- **n8n** reads and writes the same Postgres tables independently for scheduled/automated work — it has no dependency on FastAPI and no shared code contract with it.

---

### Ownership Legend
- `[FastAPI]` — Live, request-triggered, transactional writes
- `[n8n]` — Scheduled/background, direct-to-Postgres
- `[Both]` — Shared design decision or coordination point

---

## 1. Admin & Flight Management
*FastAPI owns all flight-creation and inventory-defining writes; n8n has no direct role here.*

- **[FastAPI]** Admin endpoint to create a new flight: origin, destination, departure/arrival datetime, flight number.
- **[FastAPI]** Example: create UK → Dubai flight departing 05:00, 100 total seats (20 First, 30 Business, 50 Economy).
- **[FastAPI]** Validation that seat class totals sum exactly to declared aircraft capacity.
- **[FastAPI]** Reject seat class allocation with negative or zero values, or non-integer seat counts.
- **[FastAPI]** Admin endpoint to edit flight schedule (time/route change) with cascading effect on existing bookings.
- **[FastAPI]** Admin endpoint to cancel a flight entirely, triggering downstream rebooking/refund flow.
- **[FastAPI]** Seat map/layout definition per flight (which physical seats belong to which class).
- **[FastAPI]** Adjusting seat class allocation after bookings exist — cannot shrink a class below its already-booked count.
- **[FastAPI]** Duplicate flight-number detection for the same day/route.
- **[FastAPI]** Admin role permission tiers (super-admin vs. ops-agent create/edit rights).
- **[FastAPI]** Audit log of every admin change to a flight (who changed what, when).

---

## 2. Search & Fare Rules
*Search and pricing logic must be transactionally consistent with live inventory — FastAPI territory.*

- **[FastAPI]** Search endpoint returning available seats per class for a given route/date.
- **[FastAPI]** Fare class rules: basic economy (no changes, no seat choice) vs. flexible fare.
- **[FastAPI]** Price-hold duration between search results and booking confirmation.
- **[FastAPI]** Multi-leg/connecting itinerary where one leg's fare disappears before the other is booked.
- **[FastAPI]** Currency/locale handling for displayed fares.

---

## 3. Seat Holds & Booking
*The core overselling-prevention problem must be atomic, so it lives entirely in FastAPI against Postgres.*

- **[FastAPI]** Temporary seat hold during checkout with expiry if payment isn't completed.
- **[FastAPI]** Atomic seat-class decrement to prevent two simultaneous bookings selling the same last seat.
- **[FastAPI]** Idempotency key handling for duplicate/retried booking requests.
- **[FastAPI]** Explicit overbooking policy per class (allowed with buffer vs. hard never-oversell guarantee).
- **[FastAPI]** Group booking of N seats where only some are available: partial hold, partial fail, or full fail.
- **[FastAPI]** Class-specific booking rules (e.g. First/Business allow later cutoff than Economy).

---

## 4. Changes, Cancellations & Refunds
*Cancellation/refund decisions are FastAPI; escalation on a stuck refund on a schedule is n8n.*

- **[FastAPI]** Cancellation policy branching by fare type (refundable / credit-only / non-refundable).
- **[FastAPI]** Partial cancellation on a multi-passenger booking — proportional refund and re-pricing.
- **[FastAPI]** Airline-initiated schedule change: automatic rebooking rule and fare-policy override.
- **[FastAPI]** Flight cancellation refund vs. rebook vs. travel credit, with credit expiration.
- **[n8n]** Escalation notification if a refund stays unresolved after N days.

---

## 5. Waitlist & Standby
*Joining a waitlist is a live booking action (FastAPI); promoting people off it is background polling (n8n).*

- **[FastAPI]** Add passenger to waitlist when a class/flight is full.
- **[FastAPI]** Waitlist priority rule (loyalty tier vs. booking time vs. fare class).
- **[n8n]** Scheduled job to detect freed-up seats and promote the next waitlisted passenger.
- **[n8n]** Notification window before an auto-promoted seat is reassigned to the next person if unclaimed.
- **[Both]** Row-locking so a gate-agent action and an n8n promotion run can't assign the same freed seat twice.

---

## 6. Scheduled Automations
*Time-based, no live user request in the loop — this is n8n's core job.*

- **[n8n]** Check-in reminder email, timezone-correct for origin/destination.
- **[n8n]** Price-drop alert with de-duplication so it doesn't fire on every micro-fluctuation.
- **[n8n]** Daily/weekly ops reporting (load factor, revenue per flight) pulled from Postgres.
- **[n8n]** Detection and suppression of reminder workflows for flights already cancelled.

---

## 7. Fraud, Policy & RAG Support
*Kept entirely in n8n scheduled jobs reading directly from Postgres and Pinecone, no FastAPI involvement.*

- **[n8n]** RAG-drafted answer to policy questions must reflect the booking's actual fare rule, not a generic match.
- **[n8n]** Human approval gate before any RAG-drafted answer is sent via Gmail.
- **[n8n]** Scheduled bot/mass-booking fraud-scoring job scanning recent bookings.
- **[n8n]** Scheduled ingestion pipeline embedding updated policy docs into Pinecone.
- **[n8n]** Batch review job scanning historical bookings for fraud patterns missed in real time.

---

## 8. Approval & Autonomy Boundaries
*Applies across both systems — the policy itself is a design artifact, not code.*

- **[Both]** Explicit list of actions auto-approved (reminders, standard in-policy refunds).
- **[Both]** Explicit list of actions requiring human sign-off (schedule-change compensation, denied-boarding compensation).
- **[Both]** Audit trail sufficient to justify an automated decision to a regulator or complaint review.

---

## 9. Shared Database Architecture (FastAPI + n8n dual-writer)
*n8n reads/writes Postgres directly with no FastAPI contract — these rules keep the two systems from corrupting each other's data.*

- **[Both]** Table-ownership rules: which system is the sole writer of which tables.
- **[Both]** Postgres-level invariants (CHECK constraints, foreign keys, enums) since n8n bypasses FastAPI validation.
- **[n8n]** Change-detection mechanism for n8n: polling vs. LISTEN/NOTIFY vs. a status/flag column, with justification.
- **[n8n]** Row-locking strategy (e.g. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) to prevent double-processing in polling workflows.
- **[Both]** Reconciliation/audit job to catch inconsistent states from a failed or partial n8n write.
- **[Both]** Explicit conflict-resolution rule for concurrent writes (e.g. FastAPI cancellation vs. n8n waitlist promotion on the same seat).

---

## 10. Core Infrastructure
*The connective tissue across the whole stack.*

- **[FastAPI]** Typed request/response schemas and validation for every booking-affecting endpoint.
- **[FastAPI]** Idempotency header/key contract for all write endpoints.
- **[Both]** Supabase Postgres as the single ledger of truth for flights, seats, and bookings.
- **[n8n]** Pinecone index maintenance job for policy docs and fraud-pattern embeddings.
- **[n8n]** Gmail node integration for all customer-facing scheduled notifications.
- **[FastAPI]** Gmail send for transactional, request-triggered emails (booking confirmation, cancellation receipt).
